This map is of my hometown, so I’m more interested to see what database querying reveals, and I’d like an opportunity to contribute to its improvement on OpenStreetMap.org.

# Problems Encountered in the Map

After initially downloading a small sample size of the Charlotte area and running it against a provisional data.py file, I noticed five main problems with the data, which I will discuss in the following order:

Over­abbreviated street names (“S Tryon St Ste 105”)

Inconsistent postal codes (“NC28226”, “28226­0783”, “28226”)

“Incorrect” postal codes (Charlotte area zip codes all begin with “282” however a large portion of all documented zip codes were outside this region.)

Second­ level “k” tags with the value "type"(which overwrites the element’s previously processed node[“type”]field).

Street names in second ­level “k” tags pulled from Tiger GPS data and divided into segments, in the following format:

 <tag k="tiger:name_base" v="Stonewall"/> 
 <tag k="tiger:name_direction_prefix" v="W"/> 
 <tag k="tiger:name_type" v="St"/>
